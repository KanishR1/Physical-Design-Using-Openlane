## Day - 1 Inception of Open-Source EDA, OpenLane and Sky130 PDK
### Introduction to RISC-V
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that is adopted in the world of computer architecture and processor design. It was originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley in 2010 and has since grown into a global collaboration of researchers and industry experts. The key characteristic of RISC-V is its simplicity and modularity. It follows the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) design philosophy, which emphasizes a small and streamlined set of instructions that are easy to decode and execute. RISC-V offers a base set of instructions, called the "RV32I," which provides essential operations for general-purpose computing. Additional optional instruction sets, such as RV32F for single-precision floating-point operations or RV64G for 64-bit computing, can be added to meet specific application requirements. One of the major advantages of RISC-V is its open nature. The ISA specifications, reference implementations, and software tools are freely available, allowing anyone to study, modify, or implement their own RISC-V processors without licensing fees or restrictions. This openness has fostered a vibrant ecosystem of hardware designers, software developers, and researchers who collaborate and innovate around the RISC-V architecture.

### How the software applications run on the hardware ?
All the software applications we use in our daily lives rely on hardware to run. The system software is responsible for translating the application program into binary language, which the hardware can understand and execute. The primary components of system software include the Operating System (OS), Compiler, and Assembler. The OS plays a crucial role in managing various aspects of the computer system. It provides an environment for the application program to run and handles tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, and input/output operations. Depending on the underlying architecture, such as MIPS, x86, x64, or RISC-V, the OS translates the application program into assembly language instructions. The compiler is responsible for converting high-level programming languages, like C or Java, into assembly-level language instructions. This translation process is influenced by the specific architecture on which the software will be executed. Different architectures have their own instruction sets, and the compiler ensures that the instructions generated are compatible with the targeted architecture. Once the code is in assembly language, the assembler comes into play. It takes the assembly code and translates it into binary code, which is a sequence of 0s and 1s that can be directly dumped into the hardware.

### Open-Source Digital ASIC Design
![Opensoure ASIC req](https://github.com/KanishR1/vsd_openlane_workshop/assets/88330171/7c3b4a4d-ff10-4b12-89db-0e6c8cb6a612)
Designing Application Specific Integraded Circuits (ASICs) basically requires three elements : RTL IPs, EDA Tools and PDKs.

**RTL IPs**, or Register Transfer Level Intellectual Property, refer to pre-designed and pre-verified digital hardware components or blocks that are described at the Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL is a hardware description language (HDL) representation of a digital circuit or a portion of a circuit. In the context of integrated circuit (IC) design, an IP refers to a reusable building block that can be integrated into a larger design. RTL IPs, specifically, are designed at the register transfer level, which represents the flow of data between registers and the operations performed on that data.These IPs can be licensed from IP vendors or developed in-house. They provide a level of abstraction that allows designers to focus on higher-level design aspects rather than implementing low-level details from scratch. RTL IPs offer various advantages, such as improved productivity, faster time-to-market, and increased design reliability. By using RTL IPs, designers can leverage optimized and well-tested building blocks, reducing the likelihood of errors and bugs. Additionally, using RTL IPs promotes design reuse, enabling designers to create complex systems by assembling and integrating different IP blocks.

**EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools** are software applications used in the design, development, and analysis of electronic systems, including integrated circuits (ICs), printed circuit boards (PCBs), and other electronic components. These tools automate various tasks involved in the design process, increasing efficiency and reducing time-to-market.

**Process Design Kit (PDK)** is a set of files used within the semiconductor industry to model a fabrication process for the design tools used to design an integrated circuit.  PDK’s are often specific to a foundry, and may be subject to a non-disclosure agreement.  While most PDK’s are proprietary to a foundry, certain PDKs are opensource and entirely within the public domain.Traditionally, PDKs have been proprietary and provided by semiconductor foundries, limiting access and customization options for IC designers. However, open-source PDKs aim to promote collaboration, innovation, and accessibility by making the design kit freely available to the community. By providing an open-source PDK, designers can modify and customize the kit to suit their specific requirements. This flexibility allows for greater innovation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing within the design community. It also lowers the barriers to entry for new designers and encourages participation in the development of new ICs and electronic systems. Some of the  open-source PDKs are : SKY130, GFU180, ASAP7 etc

### Simplified RTL to GDSII flow 
![rtl2gds2](https://github.com/KanishR1/vsd_openlane_workshop/assets/88330171/9ebd56da-1b8f-4f62-8ab0-9a0db0a0a1fc)
The RTL to GDSII flow basically involves :
1. **RTL Design** -  The process begins with the RTL design phase, where the digital circuit is described using a hardware description language (HDL) like VHDL or Verilog. The RTL description captures the functional behavior of the circuit, specifying its logic and data paths.

2. **RTL Synthesis** - RTL synthesis converts the high-level RTL description into a gate-level netlist. This stage involves mapping the RTL code to a library of standard cells (pre-designed logic elements) and optimizing the resulting gate-level representation for area, power, and timing. The output of RTL synthesis is typically in a format called the gate-level netlist.

3. **Floor and Power Planning** - is a crucial step in the digital design flow that involves partitioning the chip's area and determining the placement of major components and functional blocks. It establishes an initial high-level layout and defines the overall chip dimensions, locations of critical modules, power grid distribution, and I/O placement.The primary goals of floor planning are: Area Partitioning, Power Distribution, Signal Flow and Interconnect Planning, Placement of Key Components, Design Constraints and Optimization.

4. **Placement** - Placement involves assigning the physical coordinates to each gate-level cell on the chip's layout. The placement process aims to minimize wirelength, optimize signal delay, and satisfy design rules and constraints. Modern placement algorithms use techniques like global placement and detailed placement to achieve an optimal placement solution.

5. **Clock Tree Synthesis** - Clock tree synthesis (CTS) is a crucial step in the digital design flow that involves constructing an optimized clock distribution network within an integrated circuit (IC). The primary goal of CTS is to ensure balanced and efficient clock signal distribution to all sequential elements (flip-flops, registers) within the design, minimizing clock skew and achieving timing closure.

6. **Routing** - Routing connects the gates and interconnects on the chip based on the placement information. It involves determining the optimal paths for the wires and vias that carry signals between different components. The routing process needs to adhere to design rules, avoid congestion, and optimize for factors like signal integrity, power, and manufacturability.

7. **Sign-off** - Sign-off analysis refers to the final stage of the electronic design process, where comprehensive verification and analysis are performed to ensure that the design meets all the necessary requirements and specifications. It involves a series of checks and simulations to confirm that the design is ready for fabrication and meets the desired functionality, performance, power, and reliability targets. 

8. **GDSII File Generation** - Once the layout is verified and passes all checks, the final step is to generate the GDSII file format, which represents the complete physical layout of the chip. The GDSII file contains the geometric information necessary for fabrication, including the shapes, layers, masks, and other relevant details.

### Introduction to OpenLANE

## Day - 2 Good Floorplan Vs Bad Floorplan and Introduction to Libraryt Cells
### Utilization factor and Aspect ratio

<img width="307" alt="a" src="https://github.com/KanishR1/vsd_openlane_workshop/assets/88330171/357c02fa-b849-41a1-8720-8c47094c220e">

```
Utilization Factor = Area occupied by netlist
                     -------------------------
                      Total area of the core 
```
```
Aspect Ratio = Height of Core
              ----------------
               Width of Core
```
When the aspect ratio is 1, the chip is squared in shape.

### Preplaced Cells
The pre-placed cells are typically larger and more complex modules, such as memory blocks, complex functional units, or other predefined structures that are designed separately and then positioned in the layout before the placement and routing stages. Pre-placed cells are often used for several reasons:Performance optimization, IP integration and Power optimization. The preplaced cells are reused in the designs.These pre-placed cells should be surrounded by de-coupling capacitors. Decoupling capacitors are large capacitors that store electrical charge. They have a voltage across them similar to that of the power supply. When a circuit switches, the decoupling capacitor acts as a power source for the circuit, effectively isolating it from the main power supply. During switching events, the decoupling capacitor supplies the necessary current to the circuit. To minimize voltage drops, these capacitors are positioned in close proximity to the circuit. They ensure that the circuit receives the required current during switching operations. The purpose of the decoupling capacitor is to charge the circuit. When a switching activity occurs, the decoupling capacitor transfers some of its charge to the circuit. During periods of no switching activity, the decoupling capacitor replenishes its charge from the power supply.

<img width="347" alt="59" src="https://github.com/KanishR1/vsd_openlane_workshop/assets/88330171/6b36fb30-980c-48ab-8c27-895f9e740867">

### Decoupling Capacitor
Decoupling capacitors constitute an indispensable element within the realm of electronic circuit design, particularly in the context of integrated circuits (ICs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs). Their primary purpose revolves around the stabilization of power supply voltage levels, a crucial function in mitigating noise and upholding consistent voltage for delicate components. As electronic apparatuses operate at elevated frequencies, abrupt shifts in current demands can incite voltage fluctuations and unwanted noise, thereby resulting in performance dilemmas and signal deterioration. Decoupling capacitors, akin to a safeguard, establish a local storehouse of electrical charge that can swiftly respond to these fluctuations. Essentially, they act as reservoirs, storing and disbursing electrical energy as required, effectively sieving out undesirable noise and voltage oscillations. 

Decoupling capacitors are strategically sited in close proximity to power-thirsty constituents, such as microprocessors, digital logic circuits, or high-speed memory modules, where they adeptly soak up and provide instant current requisites. Through curbing voltage fluctuations, they heighten the overall fidelity of signals and prevent potential issues like ground disturbance, signal interference, and electromagnetic perturbations. The physical configuration of decoupling capacitors necessitates judiciously determining the appropriate capacitance magnitude, voltage rating, and package dimensions based on the distinct requisites of the circuit. The capacitance value must adequately meet current necessities and the frequency spectrum of the circuit. Greater capacitance values promise superior noise suppression but can introduce bulkier physical dimensions and cost ramifications. Furthermore, the placement of decoupling capacitors assumes paramount importance, requiring them to be positioned as proximate as feasible to the power and ground pins of the targeted components, thereby minimizing inductance and resistance along the supply path. This close proximity ensures efficient energy transmission between the power source and the components, concurrently diminishing impedance and maximizing the capacitor's efficacy.

### Power Planning
Power planning in integrated circuit (IC) design involves the careful consideration and distribution of power and ground connections to ensure proper functionality and performance of the chip. One important aspect of power planning is the placement of multiple ground (GND) and supply voltage (VDD) points throughout the IC layout.The need for multiple GND and VDD points arises due to several reasons:By providing multiple GND and VDD points, the power can be distributed more evenly throughout the chip, reducing the chances of voltage drops and improving overall power delivery efficiency. Ground bounce occurs when there are variations in the voltage levels of different GND points due to transient currents. Similarly, power supply noise refers to fluctuations in the VDD levels caused by switching events. By strategically placing multiple GND and VDD points, the impact of ground bounce and power supply noise can be minimized, improving circuit performance and reducing the risk of functional failures.

### Pin Placement
Pin placement in physical design is all about how and where we put the input/output pins on a chip or circuit board. It's important because it affects how well signals move around, how little they get messed up, and how easy it is to build and test the device. We have to think about things like keeping the signals strong, spreading out power evenly, managing heat, and making sure it fits with standard connectors and packaging. When we do this pin placement right, it makes the electronic system more reliable, easier to build, and more user-friendly.

### CELL DESIGN AND CHARACETRIZATION FLOWS

Library is a place where we get information about every cell. It has differents cells with different size, functionality,threshold voltages. There is a typical cell design flow steps.
1. Inputs : PDKS(process design kit) : DRC & LVS, SPICE Models, library & user-defined specs.
2. Design Steps :Circuit design, Layout design (Art of layout Euler's path and stick diagram), Extraction of parasitics, Characterization (timing, noise, power).
3. Outputs: CDL (circuit description language), LEF, GDSII, extracted SPICE netlist (.cir), timing, noise and power .lib files

### Standard Cell Characterization Flow

A typical standard cell characterization flow that is followed in the industry includes the following steps:

1. Read in the models and tech files
2. Read extracted spice Netlist
3. Recognise behavior of the cells
4. Read the subcircuits
5. Attach power sources
6. Apply stimulus to characterization setup
7. Provide neccesary output capacitance loads
8. Provide neccesary simulation commands

Now all these 8 steps are fed in together as a configuration file to a characterization software called GUNA. This software generates timing, noise, power models.
These .libs are classified as Timing characterization, power characterization and noise characterization.


### TIMING CHARACTERIZATION

In standard cell characterisation, One of the classification of libs is timing characterisation.

#### Timing threshold definitions 
Timing defintion |	Value
-------------- | --------------
slew_low_rise_thr	| 20% value
slew_high_rise_thr | 80% value
slew_low_fall_thr |	20% value
slew_high_fall_thr |	80% value
in_rise_thr	| 50% value
in_fall_thr |	50% value
out_rise_thr |	50% value
out_fall_thr | 50% value

#### Propagation Delay and Transition Time 

**Propagation Delay** 
The time difference between when the transitional input reaches 50% of its final value and when the output reaches 50% of its final value. Poor choice of threshold values lead to negative delay values. Even thought you have taken good threshold values, sometimes depending upon how good or bad the slew, the dealy might be still +ve or -ve.

```
Propagation delay = time(out_thr) - time(in_thr)
```
**Transition Time**

The time it takes the signal to move between states is the transition time , where the time is measured between 10% and 90% or 20% to 80% of the signal levels.

```
Rise transition time = time(slew_high_rise_thr) - time (slew_low_rise_thr)

Low transition time = time(slew_high_fall_thr) - time (slew_low_fall_thr)
```
